Release  notes for Version 2.1


syntax-case now recognizes when the last clause has a pattern
consisting of a single pattern variable, and when recognized, avoids
generating the call to syntax-dispatch and the corresponding error call

converted syntax-dispatch, valid-syntax-pattern to return symbol `no'
instead of #f for no match or invalid for compatibility with systems
that represent #f and () as the same object

added hooks-CS3.ss for Chez Scheme Version 3

fixed bug in "do" that prevented multiple expressions from appearing
after the test expression

fixed bug in chi-definition that prevented "defun" syntax from being
recognized properly (would result in "invalid identifier" for internal
"defuns" and "not a vector" for top-level "defuns")

the expander now complains about raw symbols inserted into the output
of a macro.

the expander now complains about misplaced ellipses in syntax
expressions, and uses free-identifier to check for ellipses (was just
checking symbolic name).
