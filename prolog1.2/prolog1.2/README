				Scheme Prolog 1.2
				-----------------

	written by John Cleary, Alan Dewar, Vinit Kaushik and Sue Rempel
	at the University of Calgary (cleary@cpsc.ucalgary.ca).

This package provides a fairly simple interpreter for pure Prolog, implemented
in Scheme.  It is primarily intended for use in students' projects involving
implementations of Prolog.  Scheme Prolog version 1.2 is mostly a pure Prolog
interpreter, though a few built-in primitives are also included.  Delayed goals
are also supported, and an interval-arithmetic package is included.

The interval arithmetic is a form of constraint solving on real variables.
It is logically correct in the sense that no solutions to constraints are ever
rejected.  It deals correctly with rounding and truncation and can solve
non-linear constraints.

This implementation runs on Chez Scheme and on Elk, and is intended to be
portable to other Scheme implementations.
